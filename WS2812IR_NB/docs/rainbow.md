# rainbow

## The rainbow() Function

### Description

The `rainbow()` function is a mode that sets the entire LED strip to look like a gliding rainbow.

### Syntax

```
WS2812IR_NB.rainbow(int speed);
```

### Definition

This function can take a speed value as an `int`.  This value is normally set from 0-5, as anything more has the strip glide extremely slowly.
