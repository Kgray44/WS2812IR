# IR Remote

## The IR Remote Buttons

### Description

The IR remote used during the making of this library, is from DFRobot.  It looks like this:

### Buttons and Their Uses

I have only used some of the buttons in my code, although my libraries may be altered to adjust that.

* The Power button (top left) turns on and off the LED strip.
* The VOL+ button (top mid) adjusts the brightness to brighter.
* The FUNC button (top right) changes from standard mode to function mode, and back again if pressed once more.
* The Back button (2nd left) scrolls through either the modes, or the color hue depending on which mode you have it on.
* The Forward button (2nd right) does the same as the Back button, but the other way.
* The VOL- button (3rd mid) adjusts the brightness lower.
