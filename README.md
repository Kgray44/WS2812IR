# WS2812IR Library and WS2812 with IR Code Collection

## WS2812IR Library

This library is for using WS2812 LEDs with a IR Remote!

I hope to do a complete do-over of this library soon, as all of it's code is blocking.  This will not seem to be an issue, besides a delay of up to 2 seconds from when an IR remote button is pressed.  The library, as is though, works and functions correctly!

## WS2812IR Code Collection

Check out the WS2812IR_No_Blocking.ino sketch!  It doesn't utilise the library, and it's code is completely non-blocking.
